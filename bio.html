**Instructions:**
* Create a basic HTML page that gives information about yourself.
* "Content is king" - think about what information people would want to see on a bio page about you, and include that information.
* Use the appropriate HTML elements as you build your page. You should include at least the following elements:
  * images, links, paragraphs, headers, and lists.
* Include things like a list of your favorite movies, links to your favorite sites, a paragraph about your work experience. Whatever you like.
**Note:**
* Don't forget the metadata information about the document, and the other required elements!
**Bonus:**
* Create a contact form with labels and fields for email address and a message.
